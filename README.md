# The Wild Oasis ðŸŒ´

This project was made in the React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The Wild Oasis is a beautifully designed, interactive resort website built with **Next.js** and **React**. It allows users to explore accommodations, check availability, and make bookings while providing a smooth, seamless experience. The project integrates server-side actions for booking functionality and dynamic content.

## Project Description

Built with **Next.js** for server-side rendering, it provides both client-side and server-side rendering to deliver optimal performance and user experience.

Key features include an easy-to-use booking system, smooth navigation between pages, and user authentication for managing reservations. The backend is powered by **Next.js API routes**, which handle bookings and interactions with a database.
